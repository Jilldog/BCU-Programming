Git for BCU Programming Community

Getting Started
---------------

The framework of this is built up on the [JUCE](https://github.com/julianstorer/JUCE) framework. It is a cross-platform development library for creating C++ programs, mostly Audio based.

You have to download the Git version and build the executables.

The contents of this repo change very frequently and will not be published as a facebook item so check back regularly for updates to code and new files.

Requirements
------------

You will need JUCE to be built and installed at these locations:

C:\JUCE on Windows
\juce\ on Mac (ROOT level not home directory).

If you don't put it here, you'll need to modify the Jucer files when you launch a project, not huge task but you need to remember to do it!

If you want to build a VST you need the VST SDK from [here](http://www.steinberg.net/en/company/developer.html). You'll need to create a third party developer account to access it. You need V2.4! Not any other.
Install the VST SDK here:

C:\SDKs on Windows
\SDKs\ on Mac (again Root Level).

Also, get Visual Studio Express 2010 for Windows from [here](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/downloads#d-2010-express), the C++ version.
If on Mac get XCode from the App Store

Install these in their default ways

Any problems post on the Facebook group!
