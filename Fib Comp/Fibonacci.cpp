// This include allows you to use a function called cout which prints information to the console
#include <iostream>

// The function main is called when a program first runs.
int main()

	// These are the four variables you will need
	unsigned long long next;
	unsigned long long current = 1;
	unsigned long long previous = 0;
	unsigned int counter; // What value should counter be!

	// Devise your code to generate the correct numbers, the theorum is
	// x[n] = x[n-1] + x[n-2]. Find the 80th Number and store it in current.
	// It can be done in a for or a while loop!

	cout << "80th: "<< current;
